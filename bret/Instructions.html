        In this game, your task is to collect boxes ðŸ“¦, each worth {{ C.BOX_VALUE }}.
        There are {{ C.NUM_BOXES }} boxes in total.
        By clicking <b>Start</b> you collected 1 box per {{ C.TIME_INTERVAL }} second(s).
    </p>
    <p>
        There is, however, a bomb ðŸ’£ hidden in one of the boxes.
        If you collect it, all boxes will be destroyed, and your payoff will be 0.
        Your task is to choose when to stop collecting, hoping you did not collect the bomb ðŸ’£.
        To stop collecting you may click <b>Stop</b> at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of the task, the bomb's location will be revealed by clicking <b>Solve</b>.
