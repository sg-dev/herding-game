    <p>The first entry in each cell represents your payoff, while the second entry represents the payoff of the person you are matched with. To be clearer, your neighbourhood may be composed by more than one person: we will compute your payoff by applying the above matrix to all cooperators and defectors in your neighbourhood.</p>

    <p>Suppose first that the tax rate is 0%:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If you select Cooperate and the other selects Cooperate, you each make 5.</li>
    <li>If you select Cooperate and the other selects Defect, you make 3 while the other makes 10.</li>
    <li>If you select Defect and the other selects Defect, the payoff is obtained in the exact opposite manner as above.</li>
    <li>If you select Defect and the other selects Defect, you each make 4.</li>
</ul>

<p>Suppose now that the tax rate is 50%:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If you select Cooperate and the other selects Cooperate, you each make 5 and pay no taxes because you have both cooperated.</li>
    <li>If you select Cooperate and the other selects Defect, you make 3 while the other makes 10. You then pay 1.5 in taxes and the other pays 5. In the end, you receive back 6.5 and the other 0 because you have cooperated and the other has defected. In the end, you get 11 and the other gets 5.</li>
    <li>If you select Defect and the other selects Defect, the payoff is obtained in the exact opposite manner as above.</li>
    <li>If you select Defect and the other selects Defect, you each make 4 and pay 2 in taxes. In the end, you each get 2.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Once you and the person(s) you are paired make choices, those choices will be highlighted and your payoff displayed.</p>
