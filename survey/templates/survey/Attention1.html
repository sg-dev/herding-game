	    <b> Taxation </b>
	    <p>The earnings of all players are taxed and the taxed amount is placed in the public pot. The public pot is then redistributed equally among the collaborating players.
	    Suppose for simplicity, that you only play with one player.
	    You choose <b>not to collaborate</b>, while Player X <b>collaborates</b>.
	    Consider the example where the tax rate is 50% and the earnings are the ones shown in the table above.
	        <ol>
	          <li>You earn 8 and Player X earns 5 points.</li>
	          <li>Given the tax rate of 50% you pay 4 and Player X pays 2.5 into the public pot. The public pot now contains 6.5.</li>
	          <li>The 6.5 are distributed equally among the players choosing to collaborate. In this case only Player X collborates and gets 6.5 while you get 0. In total you receive 4 (4 + 0) and player X receives 9 (2.5 + 6.5).</li>
	        </ol>

	    Consider a second example with a tax rate of 10%.
	        <ol>
	          <li>You earn 8 and Player X earns 5 points.</li>
	          <li>Given the tax rate of 10% you pay 0.8 and Player X pays 0.5 into the public pot. The public pot now contains 1.3.</li>
	          <li>The 1.3 are distributed equally among the players choosing to collaborate. In this case only Player X collborates and gets 1.3 while you get 0. In total you receive 7.2 (7.2 + 0) and player X receives 5.8 (4.5 + 1.3).</li>
